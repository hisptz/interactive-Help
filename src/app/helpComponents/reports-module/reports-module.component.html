    <h3>Reporting functionality in DHIS 2</h3>
    <p>The reporting module in DHIS 2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how to use them
      to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</p>
    <p>Standard reports: Standard reports are built on report tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for
      more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made
      available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF files which makes them
      ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </p>
    <p>Dataset reports: Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either
      raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports.
      This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</p>
    <p>Dashboard: The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display up to four updated charts as well as
      shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</p>
    <p>Data Visualizer: Do flexible visualizations of your data as charts and data tables. Any numbe of indicators and data elements
      can be included. Several chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts.
      The charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal dashboard.
      Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </p>
    <p>Report tables: These are very configurable table outputs of your data, either showing raw or aggregated data, as well as indicator data.
      These tables are used as either a data source for more advanced reports, for export to external systems,
      or as a crude report itself, and are exportable to pdf, excel, csv and jasper design files. These tables
      represent a very dynamic, flexible and quick way to look at the data. Report tables can be set up with parameters
      to make them reusable over time and place.</p>
    <p>Orgunit distribution reports: These reports are generated off the orgunit group set
      information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of health facilities that are located in a given area
      (any level in the hierarchy). These reports are automatically generated and display the information in both
      tables and charts, and downloads in pdf, excel, and csv are available.</p>
    <p>Reporting rate summary: These reports provide a nice overview of how many facilities that have submitted their data
      for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages showing the reporting rate for all or single data sets.</p>
    <p>Excel pivot tables: Excel pivot tables represents a very powerful way to analyse your data and DHIS 2
      links directly to the pivot tables so that all the data will be available and updated in your Excel file. This can be a
      very useful tool for users that prefer working with the data offline. To update your local pivot tables you need
      the my Datamart tool which connects to the online server and downloads the latest data. This update will typically
      take place once a month when new data is available, but do not require a constant internet connection like the other
      reporting tools (if you are connecting to an online DHIS 2 server).</p>
    <p>Web-based pivot tables: The built in pivot table tool is a simple web-based tool to display indicator
      data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for some basic pivoting manipulations of the tables.
      It is a quick and easy way to look at many indicator values at the same time (by orgunit and/or period), but does not
      have the same functionality as the offline Excel pivot tables. </p>
    <p>GIS: Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that
      you have coordinates for all your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels
      from country polygons to facility points. See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built
      into DHIS 2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your organisation units and the maps will be available.</p>

  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Using standard reports'">
    <h3>Using standard reports</h3>
    <p>You access the available reports from the Services drop-down menu, by selecting Reports. In the report menu in
      the left bar, click Standard Report. A list of all pre-defined reports will appear in the main window. </p>
    <p>You run/view a report by clicking on the white and green arrow next to the report you want. You will then
      see a report parameter window where you must fill in the values needed for orgunit and/or reporting month, depending on
      what has been defined in the underlying report table(s). Click on "Get Report" when you are ready. The report will either
      appear directly in your browser or be available as a .pdf file for download, depending on your browser settings for handling pdf
      files. You can save the file and keep it locally on your computer for later use. </p>
  </div>



  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Using report tables'">
    <h3>Using report tables</h3>
    <p>Report tables is a simple-to-use tool for creating tabular analysis. To run a report table first navigate
      to the list of available report tables in Services-&gt;Reports-&gt;Report Tables and the click on the Green and white arrow
      (the first symbol in the operations list) next to the report table you want to view. </p>
    <p>Report parameters: Most report tables have parameters, which means that you can filter which orgunits and/or periods you want
      in the report. This makes the reports much more reusable. When you run the report table a Report parameter window
      will open and ask the user to input values for the selected parameters. The possible parameters are Reporting Month
      and Organisation Unit, and either one of these or both will show in the window. After selecting the values click on the Get Report button.</p>
    <p>Export/view options: When the report table is ready it will be displayed in a html view. The report table can be exported to pdf
      (for better printing and easier saving), excel, csv, and also to a standard report format (Jasper) with a nicer table and
      a chart shown in pdf, or as a jasper design file for further improvements and changes to the report design before uploading
      it as a standard report (see the Creating standard reports section).</p>
  </div>


  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Using dataset reports'">
    <h3>Using dataset reports</h3>
    <p>Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen filled with either
      raw or aggregated data. These are only available for data sets that have custom data entry forms and
      not for default or section forms.</p>
    <p>You can access data set reports from the Report menu under Services.</p>
    <p>A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your report:</p>
    <p>Dataset: The data set you want to display.</p>
    <p>Reporting period: The actual period you want data for. This can be aggregated as well as raw periods.
      This means that you can ask for a quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected monthly.
      A data set's period type (collection frequency) is defined in data set maintenance. First select the period type
      (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and then select one of the available
      periods from the dropdown list below. Use Prev and Next to jump one year back or forward.</p>
    <p>Use data for selected unit only: Use this option if you want a report for an orgunit that has children,
      but only want the data collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its children.
      If you want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do not want to tick this option.</p>
    <p>Reporting Organisation unit: Here you select the orgunit you want the report for. This can be at any level in
      the hierarchy as the data will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick the option above).</p>
    <p>When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on "Generate". The report will appear in html view in a
      printer-friendly format. Use print and save as functions in the browser to print or save (as html) the report.</p>
  </div>


  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Using resources'" >
    <h3>Using resources</h3>
    <p>The resource tool allows you to upload both files from your local computer to the DHIS server and to add links
      to other resources on the Internet through URLs. If you want to share the direct link to the DHIS resource you can
      right clik on the "view resource" button and copy the link address.</p>
    <p>The create a resource click on the "Add new" button. Enter a name for the resource, then choose between uploading a
      file or external URL. If you chose file upload click "Choose file" and select your file your local computer.
      If you chose URL enter the link to the resource on the Internet. Then click "Save".</p>
  </div>

  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Using reporting rate summary'" >
    <h3>Using reporting rate summary</h3>
    <p>Access the reporting rate summary from the Services-&gt;Reports menu. Reporting rate summaries will show how many
      datasets (forms) that have been submitted by organisation unit and period. You an use one of three different methods
      to calculate completeness; 1) based on complete button in data entry, 2) based on a set of defined compulsory data elements, or 3)
      based on the total registered data values for a dataset. </p>
    <p>To run the report do the following:</p>
    <p>Select an orgunit from the tree.</p>
    <p>Select one of the completeness methods.</p>
    <p>Select all or one dataset (All will give you a report with all datasets for the seelcted orgunit.
      One dataset will give you a report with completeness for all the children of the selected orgunit.</p>
    <p>Select a period type and a period from the list of available periods for that period type. Move back/forward one year by
      using the Prev/Next buttons.</p>
    <p>Then the report will be shown automatically.</p>
    <p>Change any of the parameters above and the report will be updated automatically.</p>
  </div>

  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Using organisation unit report'">
    <h3>Using organisation unit reports</h3>
    <p>You can access the Orgunit Distribution reports from the left side menu in the Services-&gt;Reports module. </p>
    <p>Orgunit distribution reports are reports that show how the orgunits are distributed on various properties
      like type and ownership, and by geographical areas.</p>
    <p>The result can be presented in a table-based report or in a chart.</p>
    <p>Running a report:</p>
    <p>To run a report first select an orgunit in the upper left side orgunit tree. The report will be based on orgunits
      located under the selected orgunit. The select the orgunit group set that you want to use, typically these are Type, Ownership,
      Rural/Urban, but can be any user-defined orgunit group set. The you can click on either Get Report to get the
      table-based presentation or Get chart to get the same result in a chart.</p>
