    <h3>Running Validation Rule Analysis</h3>

    <p>You can access Validation Rule Analysis from the Services-&gt;Data Quality menu.</p>
    <p>A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements.
      The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator which defines whether the former must be less than,
      equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met.
      For instance, a validation rule could assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants
      is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</p>
    <p>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data registered in the system.
      Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition defined through the validation rule expression is not met,
      ie. the condition is false.</p>
    <p>Selecting what data to validate: </p>
    <p>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis.
      The date picker widget may be used to select dates. </p>
    <p>Second, choose between including all validation rules or all validation rules from a single group. </p>
    <p>Third, choose between including the selected organisation unit only or the selected organisation unit with all
      children in the analysis. Fourth, select the organisation unit. Finally, click validate.</p>
    <p>Validation results:</p>
    <p>The analysis process will run for a while depending on the amount of data that is being analysed.
      If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying validation passed successfully is displayed. </p>
    <p>If validation violations were found, they will be presented in a list. The organisation unit, period,
      left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. </p>
    <p>The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation.
      This will open a popup screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and
      their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to fix incorrect data.</p>
    <p>The validation violations can be exported to a PDF document by clicking on the Download as PDF button,
      and to a Microsoft Excel workbook by clicking on the Download as Excel button.</p>

  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Std Dev Outlier Analysis'" >
    <h3>Std Dev Outlier Analysis</h3>

    <p>You can access Outlier analysis from the Services-&gt;Data Quality menu.</p>
    <p>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are numerically
      distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance, but they often indicate a measurement error or
      a heavy-tailed distribution (leading to very high numbers). In the former case one wishes to discard them while
      in the latter case one should be cautios in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution.
      The analysis is based on the standard normal distribution.</p>
    <p>Select what data to analyse:</p>
    <p>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. </p>
    <p>Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. </p>
    <p>Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. </p>
    <p>Fourth, select the parent organisation unit to use. All children of the organisation unit will be included. </p>
    <p>Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard devations the data is
      allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an outlier.</p>
    <p>Analysis result:</p>
    <p>The potential outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished.
      The data element, organisation unit, period, minimum value, actual value, and maximum value will be displayed
      for each outlier. The minimum and maximum values refer to the border values derived from the number of standard
      deviations selected for the analysis. </p>
    <p>Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking
      inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either
      by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the
      defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color
      if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. </p>
    <p>Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</p>

  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Min-Max Outlier Analysis'" >
    <h3>Min-Max Outlier Analysis</h3>

    <p>The min-max value based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are outside the
      pre-defined minimum and maximum values. Minimum and maximum values can be custom defined or automatically defined
      by the system in the data administration module. See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</p>
  </div>


  <div *ngIf="selection === 'Follow-Up Analysis'" >
    <h3>Follow-Up Analysis</h3>
    <p>The follow-up analysis function will list all data values which are marked for follup-up.
      A data value can be marked for follow-up in the data entry module and in the other validation analysis variants in this module.</p>
